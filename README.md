# kicad_grouped_bom_script
Kicad BOM script for generating a csv BOM grouped by the normal fields as well as a 'populated' field

Currently it groups by the following fields footprint, value, Populated. At some point I will change this to include manufacturer part number.

To install, copy the xsl script into the location Kicad looks for BOM scripts (the default on my computer is C:\Program Files\KiCad\bin\scripting\plugins)
